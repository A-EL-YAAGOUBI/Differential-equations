The reason why this equation is difficult is because of the non-linearity caused by the Cosine function, there is no simple way to write down the solution to this equation. First we are going to visualize the solution numericaly and then we are going to attemp to understand we have visualized using hyper asymptotics a.k.a. asymptotics beyond all orders ... \n",
